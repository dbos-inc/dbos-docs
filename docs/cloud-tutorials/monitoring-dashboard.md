In this guide, you'll learn how to use the monitoring dashboard to visualize performance and issues of applications in DBOS Cloud.

### Preliminaries

In order to launch the dashboard you need to first login and register your application, as described in [cloud quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart-cloud.md). Having done so, from your application directory, run:

```
npx dbos-cloud dashboard launch
```

This command will output the URL of your dashboard. Log in with the same credentials you used to register your app.

### Exploring Your Dashboard

In the top-left corner, the dashboard provides a time selector, defaulting to the last hour. You can change this setting to navigate to a different window of time. All of the facets are subset for this time window.

Under the time selector you can find time series for the counts of logs and traces generated by your applications, summed up for every second. You can click and drag across an interesting region in the series to "zoom in". This will update the time selector and all the other panels accordingly. You can then use the time selector buttons to "zoom back out" or scroll left and right to navigate time.

On the left side, the dashboard provides a log view with the log entries generated by your applications arranged chronologically. Special application lifetime entries are colored grey and labeled as `[APP REGISTER]`, `[APP DEPLOY]` and so on. These are generated by DBOS cloud automatically and not counted in the log counts series.

On the bottom of the dashboard, there is a table of trace calls. These are captured handler, workflow, transaction and communicator invocation events, each timestamped and decorated with duration in milliseconds.

### Filtering

In the top-right corner of the app, there are filtering selectors.
1. you can pull-down to select a signle `Application Name` to display. Other application data will be filtered out.
2. you can copy-paste a specific `Trace ID` to only view logs and traces for that Trace. To clear the field, erase the text and press "return."
3. similar to Trace ID you can copy-paste a specific `Workflow` UUID to filter by that. It is cleared the same way as Trace ID.

When turning on the filtering selectors, the time window selection stays the same. Note that you may see more data for your selection if you "zoom out" in time. Note also that the Application Name selection is populated once when the dashboard is loaded. If you deploy a new application while looking at the dashboard, simply reload your browser to have the new ID choice show up.

Finally, for much faster browsing, you can set the Trace ID or Workflow UUID filter simply by clicking on the respective value in the bottom traces table.
