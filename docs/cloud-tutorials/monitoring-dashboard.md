In this guide, you'll learn how to use the monitoring dashboard to visualize performance and issues of applications in DBOS Cloud.

### Preliminaries

In order to launch the dashboard you need to first login and register your application, as described in [cloud quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart-cloud.md). Having done so, from your application directory, run:

```
npx dbos-cloud dashboard launch
```

This command will output the URL of your dashboard. Log in with the same credentials you used to register your app.

### Exploring Your Dashboard

In the top-left corner, the dashboard provides a time selector, defaulting to the last hour. You can change this setting to navigate to a different window of time. All of the facets are subset for this time window. This dashboard supports zooming out for up to 7 days of time.

Under the time selector you can find time series for the counts of logs and traces generated by your applications, summarized for every second. These two panes have a matched time axis. You can click and drag across an interesting region in the series to "zoom in".

This will update the time selector and, therefore, all the other panels. You can then use the time selector buttons to "zoom back out" or use the `<` and `>` buttons to move backwards and forwards in time.

On the left side, the dashboard provides a log view with entries generated by your applications arranged chronologically. The pane displays up to 1,000 most recent log records in the selected time period. Log records are color coded by severity level. Special application management entries are colored grey and labeled as `[APP REGISTER]`, `[APP DEPLOY]` and so on. These are generated by DBOS cloud automatically and not counted in the logs summarized count plot. You can click on a log record to browse additional metadata. In the example below, we see logs for an example app first getting registered, then undergoing schema migration, then getting deployed:

On the bottom of the dashboard, there is a table of trace calls. These are captured handler, workflow, transaction and communicator invocation events, each timestamped and decorated with duration in milliseconds.

### Filtering

In the top-right corner of the app, there are filtering selectors:

1. you can pull-down to select a single `Application Name` to display. Other applications' data will be filtered out.
2. you can copy-paste a specific `Trace ID` to only view logs and traces for that Trace. To clear the field, erase the text and press "return."
3. similar to Trace ID you can copy-paste a specific `Workflow UUID` to filter by that. It is cleared the same way as Trace ID.

When turning on the filtering selectors, the time window selection stays the same. Note that you may see more data for your selection if you "zoom out" in time. Note also that the Application Name choices are set once when the dashboard is loaded. To refresh, simply reload your browser.

For much faster filtering, you can set the Trace ID or Workflow UUID simply by clicking on the respective value in the bottom traces table. For Workflow UUID you can also open the selected workflow in the debugger. Click once to see the choices and confirm with another click:
