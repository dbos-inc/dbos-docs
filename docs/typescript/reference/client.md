title: DBOS Client
description: DBOS Client reference
---

`DBOSClient` provides a programmatic way to interact with your DBOS application from external code.
`DBOSClient` includes methods similar to [`DBOS`](../reference/transactapi/dbos-class.md)
that make sense to be used outside of a DBOS workflow or step, such as `enqueueWorkflow` or `getEvent`.

:::note 
`DBOSClient` is included in the `@dbos-inc/dbos-sdk` package, the same package that used by DBOS applications.
Where DBOS applications use the [static `DBOS` class](../reference/transactapi/dbos-class.md),
external applications use the [`DBOSClient` class](../reference/client.md) instead.
:::

### class DBOSClient

```ts
interface EnqueueOptions {
    workflowName: string;
    workflowClassName: string;
    queueName: string;
    appVersion?: string;
    workflowID?: string;
}

class DBOSClient {
    static create(databaseUrl: string, systemDatabase?: string): Promise<DBOSClient>;
    destroy(): Promise<void>;
    async enqueue<T extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<any>>(
        options: EnqueueOptions,
        ...args: Parameters<T>
    ): Promise<WorkflowHandle<Awaited<ReturnType<T>>>>
    enqueue<T extends unknown[]>(options: EnqueueOptions, ...args: T): Promise<void>;
    retrieveWorkflow<T = unknown>(workflowID: string): WorkflowHandle<Awaited<T>>;
    send<T>(destinationID: string, message: T, topic?: string, idempotencyKey?: string): Promise<void>;
    getEvent<T>(workflowID: string, key: string, timeoutSeconds?: number): Promise<T | null>;
}
```

#### `create`

You construct a `DBOSClient` with the static `create` function. 

The `databaseUrl` parameter is a [standard PostgreSQL connection URI](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING-URIS)
for the DBOS application database.
DBOS Client also needs to connect to the [system database](../../explanations/system-tables.md) of your DBOS application.
The system database is stored on the same database server as the application database and typically has the same name as your application database, but suffixed with `_dbos_sys`. 
If you are using a non-standard system database name in your DBOS application, you must also provide the name to `DBOSClient.create`.

Example: 

```ts
import { DBOSClient } from "@dbos-inc/dbos-sdk";

const client = await DBOSClient.create("postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/my_app_db");
```

#### `destroy`

Asynchronously destroys a `DBOSClient` instance.

#### `enqueue`

Enqueues a workflow, similar to [passing a queue name to `startWorkflow`](./transactapi/dbos-class.md#starting-background-workflows)
or using [`DBOS.withWorkflowQueue`](./transactapi/dbos-class.md#using-workflow-queues). 
Like `startWorkflow`, the `enqueue` method returns a `WorkflowHandle` that you can use to retrieve the workflow results 
asynchronously from an external application.

When enqueuing a workflow from within a DBOS application, the workflow and queue metadata can be retrieved automatically.
However, since `DBOSClient` runs outside the DBOS application, the metadata must be specified explicitly.
This metadata includes:

* `workflowName`: The name of the workflow method being enqueued.
* `workflowClassName`: The name of the class the workflow method is a member of.
* `queueName`: The name of the [WorkflowQueue](./transactapi/workflow-queues#class-workflowqueue) to enqueue the workflow on.
* `appVersion`: The version of your application that should process this workflow. If left undefined, it will be updated to the current version when the workflow is first dequeued. Please see [Managing Application Versions](../../production/self-hosting/workflow-recovery#managing-application-versions) for more information.
* `workflowID`: The unique ID for the enqueued workflow. DBOS Client will generate a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) if left undefined. Please see [Workflow IDs and Idempotency](../tutorials/workflow-tutorial#workflow-ids-and-idempotency) for more information.

In addition to the `EnqueueOptions` described above, you must also provide the workflow arguments to `enqueue`. 
These are passed to `enqueue` after the initial `EnqueueOptions` parameter.
By default, the workflow arguments are not type checked. 
However, you can achieve type safety for the arguments and the returned `WorkflowHandle` by specifying the function type parameter when calling enqueue.

:::tip
Note, DBOS Client is designed to work independently of your DBOS application code.
You do not need your DBOS workflow function's implementation to make `enqueue` type safe.
You only need the type declaration for the function.

Type declarations are automatically generated by the TypeScript compiler during compilation of your DBOS application.
You can copy or import the declaration from your application's [generated declaration file (aka.d.ts file)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).
::: 

Example:

```ts
// TypeScript type declaration for our sample app workflow
declare class DocumentDetective {
    static indexDocument(url: string): Promise<number>
}

// create a helper type for the workflow we are enqueuing 
type IndexDocument = typeof DocumentDetective.indexDocument;

// type safe arguments for enqueue call by use of 
// the helper type + Parameters utility type
const documentWFID = //application specific code to generate an unique ID

// Note, TypeScript infers that handle is a WorkflowHandle<number> from the
// IndexDocument function type declaration
const handle = await client.enqueue<IndexDocument>(
    {
        workflowName: 'indexDocument',
        workflowClassName: 'DocumentDetective',
        queueName: 'indexingQueue',
        workflowID: documentWFID,
    }, 
    "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.13068");
const result = await handle.getResult();
```


#### `retrieveWorkflow`

Retrieves a workflow by ID, similar to [`DBOS.retrieveWorkflow`](./transactapi/dbos-class#dbosretrieveworkflow).
Returns a [WorkflowHandle](./transactapi/workflow-handles) that can be used to retrieve information about the workflow, 
including its current state and its eventual result.

Similar to enqueue, `retrieveWorkflow` can be made type safe by use of a class declaration
and the [ReturnType Utility Class](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#returntypetype).

Example:

```ts
const handle = client.retrieveWorkflow<ReturnType<IndexDocument>>(documentWFID);
const pageCount = await handle.getResult();
```

#### `send`

Sends a message to a specified workflow. Identical to [`DBOS.send`](./transactapi/dbos-class#dbossend).

:::warning
Since DBOS Client is running outside of a DBOS application, 
it is highly recommended that you use the `idempotencyKey` parameter in order to get exactly-once behavior.
:::

#### `getEvent`

Retrieves an event published by workflowID for a given key using the [events API](../tutorials/workflow-tutorial#workflow-events).
Identical to [DBOS.getEvent](./transactapi/dbos-class#dbosgetevent)
