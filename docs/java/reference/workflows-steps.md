### @Workflow

```java
public @interface Workflow {
  String name();

  int maxRecoveryAttempts();
}
```

An annotation that can be applied to a class method to mark it as a durable workflow.

**Parameters:**
- **name**: The workflow name. Must be unique.
- **maxRecoveryAttempts**: Optionally configure the maximum number of times execution of a workflow may be attempted.
This acts as a [dead letter queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_queue) so that a buggy workflow that crashes its application (for example, by running it out of memory) does not do so infinitely.
If a workflow exceeds this limit, its status is set to `MAX_RECOVERY_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED` and it may no longer be executed.
