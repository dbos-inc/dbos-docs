:::info
This example is also available in [TypeScript](../../typescript/examples/checkout-tutorial) and [Python](../../python/examples/widget-store.md).
:::

In this example, we use DBOS and Spring Boot to build an online storefront that's resilient to any failure.

You can see the application live [here](https://demo-widget-store.cloud.dbos.dev/).
Try playing with it and pressing the crash button as often as you want.
Within a few seconds, the app will recover and resume as if nothing happened.

All source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-demo-apps/tree/main/java/widget-store).
