# Welcome to DBOS!

DBOS is a serverless platform for building reliable backend applications.
Add lightweight annotations to your app to _durably execute_ it, making it resilient to any failure.
Then, deploy your app to the cloud with a single command.

## Quickstart

Learn how to deploy an application to the cloud (and run it locally) in just a few minutes.

## Programming Guide

Learn how to annotate your application to obtain _durable execution_, making it resilient to any failure.

## Features

- **Fast, efficient serverless**.  Deploy your project for free to DBOS Cloud and experience serverless hosting [25x faster](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/dbos-vs-aws-step-functions-benchmark) and [15x cheaper](https://www.dbos.dev/blog/dbos-vs-lambda-cost) than AWS Lambda.
- **Ultra-lightweight durable execution**. Add lightweight annotations to your code to make it resilient to any failure. If your program is ever interrupted or crashes, all your workflows automatically resume from the last completed step.
- **Built-in observability**. All your workflows automatically emit OpenTelemetry traces. 
- **Exactly-once event processing**. Use durable workflows to process incoming events (for example, from a Kafka topic) exactly-once.
- **Scheduled jobs**. Run your workflows exactly-once per time interval.
- **Time travel**. Query your database as of any past point in time. Use time travel debugging to step through past workflows.
