Often, you may want assistance from an AI model in building a DBOS application.
To make sure your model has the latest information on how to use DBOS, provide it with this prompt.

## How To Use

First, use the click-to-copy button in the top right of the code block to copy the full prompt to your clipboard.
Then, paste into your AI tool of choice (for example OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude).
This adds the prompt to your AI model's context, giving it up-to-date instructions on how to build an application with DBOS.

If you are using an AI-powered IDE, you can add this prompt to your project's context.
For example:

- Cursor: Add the prompt to [your project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai).
- Zed: Copy the prompt to a file in your project, then use the [`/file`](https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/commands?highlight=%2Ffile#file) command to add the file to your context.
- Windsurf: Copy the prmopt to a file in your project, then use [`@-Mention`](https://docs.windsurf.com/chat/overview) to add the file to your context.
- GitHub Copilot: Create a [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) file in your repository and add the prompt to it.
