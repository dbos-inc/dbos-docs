# Getting Started

Welcome to DBOS! Here's the easiest path to get started:

- First, follow our [quickstart](./quickstart.md) to set up a DBOS application, build and run it locally, then serverlessly deploy it to DBOS Cloud.
- Then, follow our [programming quickstart](./quickstart-programming.md) to build your own application and see how DBOS makes it reliable.

After completing these steps, read the [SDK Tutorials](/category/dbos-sdk-tutorials/) to learn how to build more complex DBOS applications and use advanced features like [idempotency](../tutorials/idempotency-tutorial.md) and [reliable messaging](../tutorials/workflow-communication-tutorial.md).
Also, visit the [Cloud Tutorials](/category/dbos-cloud-tutorials/) to learn about the [time-travel debugger](../cloud-tutorials/timetravel-debugging.md), [monitoring dashboards](../cloud-tutorials/monitoring-dashboard.md), and [advanced application management](../cloud-tutorials/application-management.md).
